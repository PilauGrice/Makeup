user_message: "Greetings, \r\n \r\nGetting some bunch of links redirecting to makeupwithpatricia.co.uk may result in zero worth or negative impact for your website. \r\n \r\nIt really makes no difference the number of external links you have, what is key is the amount of search terms those domains are optimized for. \r\n \r\nThat is the critical thing. \r\nNot the fake Domain Authority or ahrefs DR score. \r\nAnyone can manipulate those. \r\nBUT the number of ranking keywords the sites that send backlinks to you rank for. \r\nThatâ€™s what really matters. \r\n \r\nMake sure these backlinks redirect to your site and your rankings will skyrocket! \r\n \r\nWe are introducing this exclusive SEO package here: \r\nhttps://www.strictlydigital.net/product/semrush-backlinks/ \r\n \r\nHave questions, or want clarification, reach out here: \r\nhttps://www.strictlydigital.net/whatsapp-us/ \r\n \r\nSincerely, \r\nMike Wolfgang De Smet\r\n \r\nstrictlydigital.net \r\nPhone/WhatsApp: +1 (877) 566-3738"
