  I'm Patricia — a proud mum of three girls, wife to a supportive husband, and a passionate freelance makeup artist since 2016. Though I came into makeup later in life, it’s always been part of my creative spirit. What began as a personal love has blossomed into a thriving career, with a focus on bridal and occasion makeup, and a growing clientele.

  I'm a certified MUA through the International Open Academy, and a proud HD Brows professional since 2017. Beyond the beauty chair, I run bimonthly masterclasses for Girl Meets Brush and volunteer with Look Good Feel Better at Northampton General Hospital, helping women rediscover their confidence through makeup during their most vulnerable moments.
