      testimonial_quote: 'From the moment Patricia walked in, I felt relaxed and comfortable. What a lovely person, the products are of high quality and everything was so spotless and clean. Patricia was gentle on the skin when applying make up and we enjoyed some laughs whilst trialling. The make up itself was spot on and perfect and she took the time before hand to find out how I wanted the makeup to look. Can highly recommend and cannot wait for my wedding day for have Patricia come by again.'
