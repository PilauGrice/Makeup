      testimonial_quote: 'I had my bridal make up done along with 2 bridesmaids, my Mum and glitter and gloss for my 2 little girls. I cannot recommend her highly enough for bridal make up. She did a fabulous job with us all and we all looked and felt beautiful all day. Trish also did my trial and was very accommodating to fit me in before my hen do and the make up from my trial matched how it looked on the day. she is a lovely lady with excellent communication in the build up to the day and kept us all very calm on the morning (including my impatient children!) Her prices are very reasonable for the quality that she delivers too which is a bonus. Absolutely would recommend!'

She is helpful, kind, gentle and very good at making you feel comfortable. Even touching up the makeup once she had finished a perfectionist. You will not walk away with a spec of make up wrong. Highly recommend her.'

I learnt more tonight in 90 mins with Trish about skincare, make up application and what colours go with what complexion than I have in over 100hrs of you tube videos. I was so happy with the final look and now I can recreate this look and try some new techniques out. Thank you so very much. Highly recommend 5*'

      testimonial_quote: 'Just wow! I had my make up done for my wedding by the wonderful Trish. I wanted a super natural, barely anything there look and that is absolutely what I got. I was honestly so in love with her doing my make up that I would 100% recommend. In fact I would look no further as Trish is not only friendly, professional and made every single one of my wedding party look and feel amazing! Including the smallest member who was 6 and wanted pink sparkly eyeshadow and lipgloss. Honestly, thank you! I was nervous to put such trust in someone‚Äôs hands but after our trial I was 1000% sure and no longer nervous that I would look a tad orange or ‚Äúovercaked‚Äù. THANK YOU!!'
