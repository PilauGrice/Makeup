    About Me

    As an internationally published and award-winning makeup artist, I have dedicated my career to enhancing natural beauty and creating stunning transformations. With over 10 years of experience in the beauty industry, I specialise in a variety of makeup techniques, including bridal, editorial, and fashion makeup. 

    Beyond my professional life, I am a proud mother of three beautiful girls and a loving wife. My family also includes our playful dog, who brings joy to our everyday lives. Balancing motherhood and my passion for makeup artistry fuels my creativity and inspires my work.
